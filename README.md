# ResProject-ReactJS

Using Firebase Firestore, a React project was developed where instructor 
or authorized person can upload and view Excel files containing students' exam
results. Professors can edit, delete and share the uploaded files with
students. They can also add student-specific notes and filter the files
on specific date ranges. It provides an interface that will allow
professors to easily manage exam results
